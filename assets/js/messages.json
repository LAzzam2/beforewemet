Habit. hmm.  I used to twirl my curls but that's been dropped seeing as they're gone.\n5.  Ellen.  [Fuck politics.  And pantsuits.] \n6.  I decided to leave the BC at 3 when my strategist was driving and I was lying on the concrete with my hood on, waiting for ADs to wrap shit up.

It's so clear upstate.  Beautiful.  They were the ones who introduced me to Tenacious D.  Solid boys.\n14. In Uppsala, a city north of Stockholm, there's a big festival every year for the first day of spring.  There's champagne and music all day long.  Everyone is gorgeous because they're young and Swedish.  They bring picnic lunches and blow up mattresses and cover all the grounds in the city.  It's amazing.  I would relive that if I could have my own festival. \n15. Tough call but nudity is never wrong.  Apron and birthday suit.  Speaking of which, when's your birthday?  How old are you kid?\n16. Put them in a dumpster and sell them at Sotheby's as art.\n17. Mass chaos.  We've had some house parties that left this place smelling of yuengling and youth for weeks.\n18.  Hmm.

It landed on Todd.  apparently the kiss had to be for ten seconds [where do these rules come from?] - so everyone joined in as if it was the countdown to new years.  My first thought was, 'wow. pillow lips.'  it was a great thought.  I remember he gave me a big smile afterwards, and I was so relieved.  scary good night.\n\nthen, later in the game I had to kiss the chubby kid.  who had just eaten sour cream and onion chips. literally.\nTHAT guy I ended up dating briefly a few years back.  needless to say, he is no longer chubby and would never kiss me with chip breath again.  but I think with the right person those things don't matter.\n\nI want to make breakfast in our underwear.\n \nsweet dreams josh.","LINKS":"","ATTACHMENTS":"","id":204},{"DATE":"3\/26\/2010","TIME":"7:10","AUTHOR":"josh","SUBJECT":"Re: PS","COPY":"it's your brain that I want.  but I'll take your ass in undies any day.","LINKS":"","ATTACHMENTS":"","id":205},{"DATE":"3\/26\/2010","TIME":"10:37","AUTHOR":"tal","SUBJECT":"Re: PS","COPY":"Today is rough.  \nRazors with sandpaper handles in an ice storm rough.  \nI'll make it through the shitstorm though.  \nWhen I do I'll tell you the tale of how Talia got her butt.\nI love telling stories.\n\nI'm trying to think of something I adore more than being held by the right person but I can't.\nMaybe being held while at an acoustic concert.\n\nI'M SEEING BEN HARPER FOR FREE.  soon. thanks to the greenlight people from the tim+faith project.\n\nhuzzah.\n\nare you allergic to anything besides boring people?","LINKS":"","ATTACHMENTS":"","id":206},{"DATE":"3\/26\/2010","TIME":"12:17","AUTHOR":"tal","SUBJECT":"Re: PS","COPY":"time+placeholder:\n\nThe other day I was listening to music on my iPhone, walking along, and I must have read a text or email of yours because a while later I realized that my headphones were still in my ears, but music wasn't playing.  \n[It stops when you close out of pandora to read your email or type a text.]  \n\nSo the soundtrack for all those blocks was nothing but happy thoughts of you.  \nDo you think someone can be your beat?","LINKS":"","ATTACHMENTS":"","id":207},{"DATE":"3\/26\/2010","TIME":"12:49","AUTHOR":"josh","SUBJECT":"Re: PS","COPY":"sorry, still distracted by how talia got her butt.

tall tale?","COPY":"I was thinking about the contents of my fridge, and how shameful they would be to a chef. which got me thinking about your knishes, and happiness. so here's a story about happiness.\n\nI used to be an eater, a spectacle.\n\nit started at very young age, with big plates. my pops, a creative thinker and a wise little man, is a member of the \"no getting up from the table until you finish your dinner\" camp. lingering issues about waste from being a child through a war, I suppose (he's a bit older, born in '36). that, in combination with the \"I want to raise my kids as free and autonomous individuals\" camp meant my brother and I had free reign to fill our plates as we pleased. I was an eager child, consequences be damned. there's a third camp my dad belongs to that relates, he likes big plates. really big plates, from the thrift store. which works out nicely for him because he hates matching, and has enough self-control not to get overly ambitions when filling his own plate. but not baby-josh, no no. needless to say I spent many a night alone at the dinner table pushing huge quantities of cold food around my bigass plate.\n\nmore big creative thinking: big spoons. I was also a slow eater, still am. and while 29 year old josh can argue that this allows one to enjoy their food, their company, and maybe even digest a bit better, 8 year old joshy hadn't yet figured out how to put all this into words. not that it would matter when you're late for school. it's morning time, everyone around me is spinning in whirlwinds trying to get out the door, and I'm trying desperately to get my dad's soggy scrambled eggs (I learned much later that soggy is in fact NOT how the swiss enjoy them) down my throat before we're once again late (ask me later for stories about being late). so.  josh has a problem getting food down his throat in a timely manner? dad has a solution. BFS. big fucking spoons. I'm talking serving size spoons. family size. tiny me looked comical, even sad. needless to say the big-spoon-plan backfired, or side-fired, like many of his creative solutions have. I didn't eat any faster, I did learn to eat more.\n\nfast forward through years of sped-up and slowed-down and sped-up metabolism, stop at highschool. plenty of revelations happen at that age, and I realized my body seemed to have a strange supernatural power that others didn't posses: no matter how much food I consumed, it's weight parked at the same lucky digit. having been bred to consume large quantities of food, this didn't seem like such an issue. still in school, I wasn't yet picking up the tab, and more food in the pie-hole = more happiness.  plus I came to learn the uniquess of my gift gave other people pleasure. so I became an eater, a spectacle. like ogre's beer drinking skills from revenge of the nerds, my friends, big dudes in their own right, would pit me against whatever fool hadden't yet heard of my prowess. it didn't help that I'm naturally competitive. and I learned technique: relax the mind, relax the stomach. by college I was eating two (2) chipotle burritos, both extra chicken, in one sitting, every day after the gym. that was 1st dinner. disgusting.\n\nbut there were moments that weren't disgusting; moments where my gift was in fact a gift. restaurants cater to college kids like they're fulfilling the role of surrogate-bubby, here to plump us up. but some kids are happy not to be plumped. which leaves quite a bit of food left on the plate, all going to waste. slide them on down to josh. all of them. I don't know how this helped the starving children in china, but no food left on plates means no food goes to waste. or so we thought.\n\nsee, this was the fallacy in my thinking. the fallacy seeded from big spoons, big plates, and bigger egos. it also held my salvation, that food in your face is not food gone to waste. and then one day I shipped off to virginia, to a coast I hadn't yet considered, and suddenly there was no time to eat. or sleep. and no one familiar with my competitive past to egg me on. my body didn't seem to mind, kept floating around that magic digit. and as suddenly as it begun, virginia was over. and I was making my way across this beautiful country, with a beautiful woman, so much slower and more considered than when I had made my way west to east. eventually we landed in the city of sin to visit an old friend of the past. from before everything was different. which is where my two realities met. but this is a tale of happiness, so let's get to the good part, shall we?\n\nthe four of us head out for dinner- avi, his crazy isralie wife hadas, and jenn, my free-spirited free-thinking co-pilot. how we decided on maggiano's is beyond me, probably had something to do with the vegas air, but we did. it was a disney sort of mood. and on and on. the waitress makes her rounds on down to me. the fettuccine. alfredo, please. only there's a hold-up. she needs to know if I want the half, or the full. and I grin. and avi's eyes grow real wide. and hadas smacks her forehead. and jen looks confused. not one to make a big deal I politely ask for the big-boy size. she gets an eyeful of my size-medium frame and asks if I'm sure. she's worked there a few years, and has yet to witness any man, or person for that matter, polish off the full alfredo. woman, I say (I don't think I actually said woman), I hope your shift doesn't get off soon, cause I'm about to change this game forever (I did actually say that, or something like it). off goes the waitress to get the party started. avi's bouncing up and down in his booster-seat, hadas tries to explain to jen what she's about to witness. and then time stops.\n\nat this point in the tale we have to pause briefly so I can do a poor job of explain the marvelous thing that is jenn maravillas. once we were exiting a bar in SF, and one of the boys coming in blurted \"oh! leopard!\" I don't think he meant to, it's just what jenn inspires in her surroundings. and there was no way that kid could have known how right he was. the first time I met her was on a street corner, she invited me for eggs. jenn is an interpretive dancer. jenn is an interpretive healer. jenn is an interpretive everything. at BC, she and I would sit on the floor in the corner of class, she'd spill out literally 53 markers from her bottomless bag, and go to town scribbling and making visual sense out of visual mess. at one point in your life you and she will cross paths. and, like all the rest of the world, you'll fall madly in love with her. she is everything one could ever want a friend and a muse to be.\n\njenn turns to me and says, you know josh, that's a really disrespectful way to relate to food. food is the source of life, and it deserves to be treated that way.\n\nand like that my eating career is finished. the enormous plate\/bowl was presented, comically enormous, and I had ZERO appetite. unprecedented. I nibbled around the edges; didn't want to make her feel bad for killing my mojo. but the fettuccine was like a foreign object in my mouth. my body didn't recognize it. the waitress teased me, though I was too emotionally stunned to care. in that little instant ms. marvelous had changed the physics of my brain.\n\nand here we are. almost two years have passed, and I still eat like a normal human. what's strange is I know I have the ability, but I haven't a single desire to indulge. which is weird also, because I have a pretty compulsive and hedonistic personality. it's just no longer for me. and I'll be honest, I'm so much happier for it. what she said is an eternal truth. and in the same way we can know something, like the fact that people live on the other side of the earth, it's hard for it to be truly real, unless you go visit those people. and now I both love and respect food. the end. of this tale about happiness. was that a good story?\n\n<3 josh","LINKS":"","ATTACHMENTS":"","id":348},{"DATE":"3\/27\/2010","TIME":"15:15","AUTHOR":"tal","SUBJECT":"gchat","COPY":"kobrin","LINKS":"","ATTACHMENTS":"","id":349},{"DATE":"3\/27\/2010","TIME":"15:15","AUTHOR":"tal","SUBJECT":"gchat","COPY":"you are so inconvenient","LINKS":"","ATTACHMENTS":"","id":350},{"DATE":"3\/27\/2010","TIME":"15:16","AUTHOR":"josh","SUBJECT":"gchat","COPY":"the worst","LINKS":"","ATTACHMENTS":"","id":351},{"DATE":"3\/27\/2010","TIME":"15:16","AUTHOR":"tal","SUBJECT":"gchat","COPY":":)","LINKS":"","ATTACHMENTS":"","id":352},{"DATE":"3\/27\/2010","TIME":"15:16","AUTHOR":"josh","SUBJECT":"gchat","COPY":"I can go away","LINKS":"","ATTACHMENTS":"","id":353},{"DATE":"3\/27\/2010","TIME":"15:16","AUTHOR":"tal","SUBJECT":"gchat","COPY":"no no I was going to say","LINKS":"","ATTACHMENTS":"","id":354},{"DATE":"3\/27\/2010","TIME":"15:16","AUTHOR":"josh","SUBJECT":"gchat","COPY":"but I won't","LINKS":"","ATTACHMENTS":"","id":355},{"DATE":"3\/27\/2010","TIME":"15:16","AUTHOR":"tal","SUBJECT":"gchat","COPY":"it's better to find something","LINKS":"","ATTACHMENTS":"","id":356},{"DATE":"3\/27\/2010","TIME":"15:16","AUTHOR":"tal","SUBJECT":"gchat","COPY":"albeit inconvenient,","LINKS":"","ATTACHMENTS":"","id":357},{"DATE":"3\/27\/2010","TIME":"15:16","AUTHOR":"tal","SUBJECT":"gchat","COPY":"than not see it at all","LINKS":"","ATTACHMENTS":"","id":358},{"DATE":"3\/27\/2010","TIME":"15:16","AUTHOR":"josh","SUBJECT":"gchat","COPY":"yes mam","LINKS":"","ATTACHMENTS":"","id":359},{"DATE":"3\/27\/2010","TIME":"15:17","AUTHOR":"josh","SUBJECT":"gchat","COPY":"and maybe what a pleasure it is to be surprised, even out of control","LINKS":"","ATTACHMENTS":"","id":360},{"DATE":"3\/27\/2010","TIME":"15:18","AUTHOR":"josh","SUBJECT":"gchat","COPY":"things have a way of being wonderful, no matter how hard we try to muck 'em up","LINKS":"","ATTACHMENTS":"","id":361},{"DATE":"3\/27\/2010","TIME":"15:19","AUTHOR":"tal","SUBJECT":"gchat","COPY":"I will not try to muck","LINKS":"","ATTACHMENTS":"","id":362},{"DATE":"3\/27\/2010","TIME":"15:19","AUTHOR":"josh","SUBJECT":"gchat","COPY":":)","LINKS":"","ATTACHMENTS":"","id":363},{"DATE":"3\/27\/2010","TIME":"15:19","AUTHOR":"josh","SUBJECT":"gchat","COPY":"good things will happen to you either way","LINKS":"","ATTACHMENTS":"","id":364},{"DATE":"3\/27\/2010","TIME":"15:19","AUTHOR":"tal","SUBJECT":"gchat","COPY":"le sigh","LINKS":"","ATTACHMENTS":"","id":365},{"DATE":"3\/27\/2010","TIME":"15:19","AUTHOR":"josh","SUBJECT":"gchat","COPY":"so muck!

I'm still bitter about that one.\n\nI want to know your smell.  That's such a great part of someone.  especially because it's something they are entirely, without ever trying.  it's intrinsic.  like the faces they make when they're not even thinking about their appearance.  I like the authentic things about someone the most.  Because if they're trying too hard it always seems contrived.

I knew, even then, good things. good things.\n\nbut that wasn't the saturday secret. that was just a side secret. so secret time. and freudian time. up until the recent past, I'd say less than a year, I had something else on the list, something that should be embarrassing to admit, though I don't embarrass easily. I needed her to be a flawed individual. need her to be fixed. to be saved. helped. rescued. pick one. I needed her to have something in her life that was holding her back from filthy wild success, and I needed to be the solution\/key to that something. this I suppose is tied to my need for her to be a survivor, a source of strength, and which I suppose is where prof. freud sticks his silly schnoz in the door.\n\nmy mom is a survivor. and a source of strength, a major biggie on the list. but that wasn't always the case. when a was a wee boy things were much different. she was in and out of various lockups, half-way houses, rehab programs, the works. the cause: undiagnosed bi-polar disorder, self-medicating with alcohol, without the tools to crawl out of it on her own. and until very recently, in fact to one extent or another in all of my serious relationships, I guess I needed to be able to fix that for someone. maybe because I couldn't fix it for her? who knows. one of my favoritest people in the whole wide world, she's really more a sister now, I probably would have pursued her had she met this fucked up criteria. smart. beautiful. but nothing to fix. so glad I didn't.  so glad I didn't.\n\nyou. you scare the shit out of me. your wholeness scares the shit out of me. nothing to fix, which isn't to say you aren't human or flawed. but had I never fallen clumsily into your lap, your life would have been just dandy. sure, horridly incomplete, tragically incomplete, totally joshless, but there would have been no crash and burn. you're smart, and you're beautiful, driven and successful. so much more so than I. and you'll get there all on your own steam. no need for a savior. nothing for the handyman to do. but maybe room for a partner?\n\nI don't think it's an accident that we are where we are. had you stomped into my life a year ago I wouldn't have been ready for you. would have recognized your amazingness but not been attracted to it. but now I want you. I want all of you. even the parts that frighten and intimidate me. especially those parts. and crazy as it sounds, I can't imagine ever not wanting you.\n\nyou're an amazing woman. and that's a happy saturday secret.\n\n\n\nby the by,\nabout two months ago I took a gal to the shooting range for a first date. I'm also not a guns in the house kinda kid, but I like loud noises and chaos. what will we do on our first date? will it even be dating? lets call it pre-reuniting, or something more clever. and I like pulp. sweet and sticky. and yes I just had a dirty thought. we'll save that one for next saturday's secret.","LINKS":"","ATTACHMENTS":"","id":918},{"DATE":"4\/3\/2010","TIME":"9:10","AUTHOR":"josh","SUBJECT":"Re: salut","COPY":"by the by the by, there's a package waiting for you at sadcenter","LINKS":"","ATTACHMENTS":"","id":919},{"DATE":"4\/3\/2010","TIME":"10:48","AUTHOR":"tal","SUBJECT":"Re: salut","COPY":"hey, I haven't responded because I know that wasn't an easy email and I want to give it a proper reply.\n\nBut I sailed over to the BC and THESE WATCHES ARE STUNNING.

When I got there, they were closed but I gave a love tap or two and they opened the door for me.  I'm so glad they did, not only because this tick tocking is a-rockin', but because I got to hear the story of this kindly old man whose grandfather opened the place at the turn of the century.  Richmond is nuts.  So much history.\n\nAlright, here goes.\n\nI have always been tenacious.  I knew no one else could get me where I wanted to go.  \n\nBut that's different than the strut.  Ever since college I've had this confident veneer.  Maybe it was born out of being the girl from NY in a VA college.  Maybe it was the curls.  Whatever it was, I stood out + people knew me.  They were quick to assume I knew wtf I was doing since I walked around with my head held high, but in reality I was just as clueless and insecure as the next girl; I just knew that perception is everything.  Maybe that's why I love branding so much.\n\nWith every heartbreak I became more competent and self-sufficient.  But it wasn't really until this past year that things clicked and I became wholly happy with myself.  I have no real regrets; it's something I couldn't have grasped without the experiences I earned along the way.\n\nBut if we had met a year ago, I might have needed saving.  \n\nI fell hard last summer.  I was told they were drawn to me because of that assumed confidence.  \nBut in reality, I was soft on the inside.  Still am.  I just want to take care of someone.  \nI don't think the capacity for independence should clash with that.  And I don't think it does.  \n\nI don't want to go through life alone.  In fact, my greatest fear is growing old alone.\n\nAlright, parents.\n\nMy father is brilliant and fun as hell.  My mother says I'm the female version of him.  He left her a few years ago.  Technically, they're separated, but they're both with new people now.  He taught me to never settle.  The back story is, his mother was dying of cancer when he was in his late 20s - my parents got married in the hospital room.\n\nThings came tumbling down my sophomore year of college.  I don't blame my dad; both of my parents are strong willed, vocal people.  That couldn't have been easy all the time.  I think it may have been part of a midlife crisis too.  He bought a Harley and all that.\n\nThings are better now.  My father is living with his girlfriend and she is literally the kindest, most gracious woman I have ever met.  They both love the Grateful Dead.  It's great.  I love that he's happy.  It just took a while for me to get over the initial sting.  My mom's scenario is almost identical, except they're not living together - but her bf is so damn sweet.  It's ridiculous.  I guess they both needed someone to balance them out.\n\nMy grandmother (mom's mom) was a professor of biopsychology specializing in love and lust.  Which means I never left her house without being grilled about why I was X age and not married.  (She was married at 19 and popped out my mom at 20.)  I like to remind her it was the 1950s, but you can't win with that woman.  \n\nThis might have messed up some kids.  I think it just made me more aware of who and what makes me happy.\n\nLast big doozie.\n\nThe person who I fell for last summer was a woman.  My first and last female.\nNow I judge people by who they are, not their gender.  \n\nShe's one of those people that everyone is drawn to; a celebrity personality.  \nYou just want to be close to them.  It's not easy to find that.  I was sucked in.  \nI happened to be dating the perfect [on paper] person at the time.  A funny\/triathlete\/Jewboy\/copywriter.  \n\nAnd then she swooped in and got me.  I was consumed.  \n\nIf she said she wanted me today, it wouldn't be the same.  Whatever I felt isn't there anymore.  \n\nI hope you can handle this.  You deserve honesty.  \n\nThat's the juice.  With pulp, just how you like it.\n\nGive me a grocery list S'IL VOUS PLAIT.\n<3\ntal","LINKS":"","ATTACHMENTS":"","id":921},{"DATE":"4\/4\/2010","TIME":"0:41","AUTHOR":"josh","SUBJECT":"Re: salut","COPY":"I'm staring at your email and I don't know what to say. maybe it's the fact that I just literally had an 8 hour discussion with 13 other kobrins about humanism v. judaism.

I can't remember how the discussion started, I think maybe he found out I'd been sitting in on MSA meetings. and he was irate, tired of my egalitarian shit. so he posed the question, \"if you were in a room, and someone pointed a gun to your head and said choose a corner, jews or humanists, which would if be?\" he knew what corner I'd choose. and he said, \"that's too bad, because the arabs don't give a shit that you see yourself as a humanist, and they're hungry to put a bullet in your head, and the other humanists won't do a damn thing about it.\"\n\nso the discussion last night was less about what corner you'd choose, but why it was important to choose it. classic \"what is a jew\" conversation, with a twist. one of my uncles, the most observant of us present, felt he had to hold it down for the jew corner.  but on his way out the door he confessed he'd end up with the humanists. he doesn't really have a choice, he's a kobrin. the newest of my cousins, a salvadorian who fled the government with his fam, had some insights of his own. my pops who used to get bloodied in the school yard but now goes around setting up ethics committees. my mom who has never experienced segrigation or antisemitism but who's heart will swallow up hateful strangers whole. was a good time.

I know it's not gonna' matter in 10 years, but somehow it just doesn't seem right for us to see each other for the first time in an airport. save that for the second. and then there's the car ride itself. not that I've got a problem with dangerous, but that'll be off the charts. so here's the question, can we wait an extra 20 minutes to make it a little more special? it'd be about 8 by the time I landed on your doorstep. so long as I made my connection at laguardia, which is gonna' be close.\n\nhi woman. and could I have some new photography to tide me over? k thanks.

the house. 14 of us, 5 or so courses, what a beautiful mess to come home to. the cousins ran the whole show. was a milestone of sorts, not that we don't often entertain, but this was the first shindig without any help from the adults. and while they were pleased as punch and impressed to no end, they also felt a bit left out. my uncle ed put it well, they want us to do the heavy lifting, but they'd still like to do some light lifting. no problem.\n\nso in the 70s my dad moved our family out here from chicago. a story I feel like I might've recounted over the phone, damn my memory, but if not you'll get it another time. needless to say stockton was great at the time, but by the 80s earned the title of #1 murder rate per capita in the nation, #1 auto theft by the 90s, and most recently was voted most miserable city in america by forbes. oops. not something I regret, quite the education in fact, but I was definitely raised to resent my surroundings. no buen for the past, no buen for the future.\n\nand here I find myself in boulder, co. recently voted happiest place in america. and if you think that's an accident you probably think the email I got march 19th was one too. the cousins have decided we're gonna remedy my dad's mistake. so in a sense, I'm out here, so far from them, scouting. for the spot we'll all pick up and land. this time with eyes wide open.\n\nwe are epic, you and i. I caught an A's game at shea. we lost. sleep tight, knowing you are loved.","LINKS":"","ATTACHMENTS":"","id":1021},{"DATE":"4\/6\/2010","TIME":"0:53","AUTHOR":"josh","SUBJECT":"Re: hi boy","COPY":"I wonder if you were there","LINKS":"","ATTACHMENTS":"","id":1022},{"DATE":"4\/6\/2010","TIME":"6:51","AUTHOR":"tal","SUBJECT":"Re: hi boy","COPY":"Boy. \nI am buying a new shower curtain for you.\nThat's love.\n\nor embarrassment.\n\nIt's gross and I should have done this weeks ago.\n\n\nThere are a few things you should know about this house.\n\n1.  It's wicked old.  Built in 1895, I believe.  \n\nThe walls are paper thin.  I can hear everything people sing on the street.  Or scream as they toss a sack of dried beans into a wooden corn hole likely painted in frat letters because undergrads truly have a grip on how to live life.  \n\n --I'm jk.  Corn hole is fun on sunny days with good people, and a BeerBQ.--\n\n2. Two out of three of the bathrooms don't really lock.  [The one by the kitchen + the one closest to my room.]  So, always knock unless you want a roommate to stare at the floor every time they see you.\n\n3. One of my roommates talks a lot - the urban planner who's going to Germany (Alison).  Another barely talks at all (Natalie).  \nI think she thinks it's seductive but I think it's bs.  \n\nYou will adore Krystal, but she'll be in NY talking to Big Spaceship Thursday - back for prom, though, fret not.  I think she's bringing that guy I mentioned the other night.  Talented guy, her bike instructor in fact, but idk, he didn't floor me.  She will end up with a big name.  Powerhouse, that one.\nWhitney's sweet; classic CBM.  Her gentleman friend will be here too (from CA). \n\nWho else should you know?  \n\nAlison [the nonBCer]'s boyfriend, Aaron, is here more often than any of us.  He's crazy nice - a quirky biker beanpole.  I used to feel funny about coming down to the kitchen in the morning without a bra, hair and face awry, but now I'm closer to him than the quiet chick - it's been about a year now.  \n\nLaura Goodman was my AD and roommate over the summer.  \nIf adorable and polite made a Jew baby, it'd be Goody.  She's my only real tribeswoman down here.   I get her riled up sometimes.  She's been dating Neil, another second year since the beginning of first, but they don't flash it around.  She calls him her 'non-bf' - never to his face, though.  If I were him I'd throw a shitfit.  That's such crap.  Either you love someone and you're proud as fuck to be with them or you don't.  It pisses me off so much.  \n\nI think she's been preconditioned to only marry in the blood.  And I know he'd convert for her.  She doesn't think it's good enough.  FUCKING INSANE GIRL.  I just want to loosen her up sometimes and say, goddamn the surface.  Just be happy.  Let him love you, you know?\n\nhmm, who else?\n\nI'm tight with all the boy CWs, but not in the -I'll call you to go to the movies- way.  That's what the femme ADs are for.  The M CWs are good for drinks after class and ping pong.  And jestful insult sparring.  \n\nMy tightest dude-friends are two first year ADs [Billy+ Michael].  Both culture mavens, one's a few years older, one's my age.  I just love people I can learn new, cool shit from.  Michael drives me crazy sometimes [the would-have-been prom date] but we'll always have some weird bond.\n\nAnd now, to the real world people.  \nTALIA, YOU KNOW PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE BC?\nWhy, yes Joshua, I do.  \nI don't talk to them as often as I should, but they mean heaps to me.\n\nOk, I already told you about the Euros, but my NY kids are platinum.\n\nI've been best friends with Sara Mow since 7th grade.  Maria Carey went to our school as a kid, so she came back to do a Homecoming concert for VH1, and to manage the chaos, they organized the students alphabetically and shipped us on buses from one building to the other.  I am blessed with an L last name, she with an M.  \n\nWe sat together on that bus and have been bff ever since.  She's half chinese, so she always looks like a Hawaiian model since she's perpetually tan\/\/living in Miami with her bf.  No, fiance.  Balls.  Wedding approaches.  I think they're doing it in Connecticut, where he's from.  The boy gets my thumbs up.  Loves her to pieces.  Very kind kid.  Only a year or two older than us.  \n\nShe and I were always fiery in HS.  The girls in the advanced classes who still partied + ran off to the city for concerts.  Oh.  And shopped.  AND DROVE.  Her car was a green boat of a Dodge for a while.  We called it Shamu.\n\nWhew, ok.  \nOther best friend - Danielle Bergmann.  I call her Dani.  \n\nShe's a cherub-delight.  Still in NY, thank god.  A bit peeved that I'm trying to go to Crispin, she thought I'd be coming back to NYC, but she wants me to be happy.  I think I mentioned that she + her bf just broke up b\/c he's going to med school at Tufts... anyway, he was too spoiled for her.  She is so damn wonderful.  Maid of honor wonderful.  She was the one who took care of me when I got burned at the end of summer.  I can just be with her.  No fronts.  She's kind of Bridget Jones-esque.  \nI want her to be a CT here next year.  She could own this industry with cupcakes and sunshine in no time.  Girl has a handbag problem though.  Too many.  \nTALKS SUPER FAST.  But I like it.  It just means she's excited.  Energy is a good thing in my book.\n\n\nOff to buy shower curtains.  \nI hope they have one with a map of the world on it.  \nThen I can show you all the places we'll go.\n\nlove love love \nbye A's fan.","LINKS":"","ATTACHMENTS":"","id":1023},{"DATE":"4\/6\/2010","TIME":"8:48","AUTHOR":"josh","SUBJECT":"Re: hi boy","COPY":"4 times I've read this email\ntrying to be a good boy and memorize the cast\nand filling up on the most recent wonderfulness\nto grace your fingers\n\na new feeling has come\nno longer all anxious to see you - in the fear sort of way\nnow it's just setting things in their place\nlike you in my arms\n\nand that will happen much sooner than later\nand we'll talk about that period in our lives\nwhen we knew each other\nbut before we met.","LINKS":"","ATTACHMENTS":"","id":1024},{"DATE":"4\/6\/2010","TIME":"9:45","AUTHOR":"tal","SUBJECT":"Re: hi boy","COPY":"They only had a pale pink polka dotted one.
